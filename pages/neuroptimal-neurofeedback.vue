        What is NeurOptimal<sup>&reg;</sup> Neurofeedback?
      </h2>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        According to
        <a href="https://neuroptimal.com/" target="_blank" class="link"
          >NeurOptimal.com</a
        >, NeurOptimal<sup>&reg;</sup>
        neurofeedback is a holistic treatment that can help anyone with a brain
        feel calmer, clearer, and reach your optimal brain functioning.
      </p>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        Have you ever looked in a mirror and naturally started fixing your hair,
        or straightening your clothes? The mirror provided you with the
        information you needed to look your best. NeurOptimal<sup>&reg;</sup>
        neurofeedback is like holding up a mirror to your brain. NeurOptimal<sup
          >&reg;</sup
        >
        neurofeedback shows your brain how it is currently functioning and gives
        it the information to self-correct.
      </p>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        Unlike linear neurofeedback where the brain is mapped and specific areas
        of the brain are targeted, NeurOptimal<sup>&reg;</sup> dynamical
        neurofeedback<sup>&reg;</sup> gives the brain the ability to assess the
        whole brain and determine what needs to be fixed by itself. It is a
        non-directive holistic treatment that helps train your brain on how to
        reorganize itself optimally, which allows you to be more flexible and
        resilient.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h2 mb-1">
        How does NeurOptimal<sup>&reg;</sup> Neurofeedback work?
      </h2>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        The brain is responsible for receiving and processing information from
        your body and your environment, and it is able to do this through the
        central nervous system (CNS). The CNS communicates through electrical
        signals and chemicals using neurons. A single neuron can produce these
        electrical signals, or these signals can dynamically appear from large
        groups of neurons. NeurOptimal<sup> &reg;</sup> Neurofeedback tracks the
        brain's electrical signals using electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors. The
        NeurOptimal<sup>&reg;</sup> Neurofeedback system mimics the
        communication of the CNS to give the brain feedback when it detects a
        habitual inefficient pattern within the electrical activity in the
        brain. When the brain receives the feedback, it realizes the
        inefficiency of these patterns and replaces them with a more efficient
        pattern of functioning. The NeurOptimal<sup>&reg;</sup> Neurofeedback
        system is able to give this feedback to the brain through precise
        mathematical calculations that take into account a brainwaves electrical
        intensity along with the duration and frequency of that signal.
        NeurOptimal<sup>&reg;</sup> Neurofeedback focuses on optimizing brain
        performance which in turn helps your brain respond appropriately and
        faster to your body and environment.

        What should I expect from my NeurOptimal<sup>&reg;</sup> Neurofeedback
        session?
      </h2>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        With NeurOptimal<sup>&reg;</sup> Neurofeedback, you connect to the
        system, relax, then watch and listen to the program. You never have to
        say a word and you still get the benefit. According to
        <a href="https://neuroptical.com" target="_blank" class="link">
          NeurOptimal.com </a
        >, clients experience the most benefit when completing 11-20 sessions
        and notice results faster the more often they use NeurOptimal<sup
          >&reg;</sup
        >
        to train.
