        "I'm really struck by the difference between this approach and more
        traditional counseling. Thank you for your thoughtful, creative, and
        purposeful work."
      </p>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        "With RRT and the way it was given, it took pain away and increased
        strength."

      <p class="text mb-4">
        "I feel lighter... I'm even trying to think of things that used to cause
        me angst and they're just not."
      </p>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        "RRT provided a valuable technique for the future to work through mental
        challenges. Unsure in the beginning, but very helpful."
      </p>
      <p class="text mb-4">"I just feel like this weight has been lifted."</p>

        "For the last 5 years I have been wondering if the rape was going to
        ruin the rest of my life, now I know that the answer to that question is
        no, hell no!"

        "For 7 years I lived in the past, replaying the past in my head over and
        over again, wishing I could go back and erase that moment. I cried day
        and night... Heather helped me get through my traumas and taught me how
        to let go of the past... and get through the stress, the pain, and the
        suffering. Now it's really different, I have hope that there's something
        to move forward to."

    <div class="mb-6">
      <p class="small-text mb-4">by Jordan Boehler</p>
      <p class="small-text mb-4">
        Everything began falling apart when Elaine's mother informed her of the
        family trip home to Sri Lanka next year. Elaine was both excited and
        terrified. She hadn't been back to Sri Lanka- and, in fact, she cringed
        when she heard the name- since she was a teenager. She hadn't been back
        since she was sexually assaulted by her father's friend. She didn't have
        much of a relationship with her father anymore. He was a constant
        reminder of Sri Lanka, of his now ex-friend. Any time she was around
        him, Elaine was angry and hostile. She couldn't be happy around him and
        she wasn't certain why. "Looking back, I blamed my father for letting it
        happen to me, but I never told him that."
      </p>
      <p class="small-text mb-4">
        Elaine had been from therapist to therapist, and to no avail; weeks upon
        years of DBT, CBT, and the other -BT's, coupled with psychotropic
        medications and the occasional visit to a shaman, left her feeling the
        same: emotionally unstable, reactive, and discouraged. "I was leading
        this life of promiscuity, and I couldn't be in a healthy, stable
        relationship. I would constantly disassociate during sex. I was never
        really dealing with people properly. I was so stressed all the time. I
        would be triggered into panic attacks whenever I heard a man's voice who
        had an accent. I tried everything I could to get help, but nothing
        seemed to work. I spent a lot of time pretending I was fine, but I
        really wasn't."
      </p>
      <p class="small-text mb-4">
        Finally, a coworker referred Elaine to Heather, an RRT practitioner
        working with students at a local university in Colorado. Elaine was
        hesitant at first, but open to anything that could help. She walked in
        to Heather's office not knowing what to expect. "I never tried anything
        like it. Heather was the first therapist I met with that didn't ask for
        the details of what happened. She was so open and accepting. She
        described how my brain was wired, and the role of my primal instincts.
        She told me my experience was just a data processing issue. She told me
        that what I had done was ok in a way that no one had before. It changed
        everything..."
      </p>
      <p class="small-text mb-4">
        Elaine had gone into the session blaming herself for “being in a
        position to let something like that happen” to her. She left that
        session guilt-free and had to call her mother even before she left the
        parking lot. "I felt so different! Suddenly, everything was ok.
        Suddenly, it seemed like I could overcome- this thing that happened
        didn't have to define me. I had just needed to be re-wired!"
      </p>
      <p class="small-text mb-4">
        Within one month, Elaine had reconnected with her father. Together, they
        were once again able to share good memories of Sri Lanka and begin
        making new memories together. She travelled to Sri Lanka later that year
        with her family and her boyfriend. "Not only was going to Sri Lanka no
        longer an issue for me, it was actually amongst the best trips I've ever
        taken. I love that country. That man wasn't allowed to take that away
        from me. I have never felt so happy or fulfilled. I feel like I have my
        life back. Heather saved my life!"
