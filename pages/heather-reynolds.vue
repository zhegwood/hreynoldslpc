          I have a Masterâ€™s Degree in Counseling Psychology and Counselor
          Education from the University of Colorado at Denver. I am a Licensed
          Professional Counselor (LPC), Certified Hypnotherapist (CHt), and
          Rapid Resolution Therapy Specialist (RRTS).
        </li>
        <li class="text mb-4">
          I work with ages 12 and up. I have experience working in college
          counseling centers, a domestic violence advocacy agency, and spent
          nearly 5 years working exclusively with middle school kids and
          families. I work primarily with individual adults and adolescents.
        </li>
        <li class="text mb-4">
          I have extensive experience working with trauma, PTSD, sexual assault,
          abuse, depression, anxiety & panic, grief & loss, and sleep issues as
          well as pain management and mind-body healing.
        </li>
        <li class="text mb-4">
          I utilize Rapid Resolution Therapy (RRT) to clear your significantly
          challenging issues. After more than 12 years of working with clients
          who were struggling to come to terms with their difficult and painful
          experiences, I started seeking a better way and I ultimately found
          Rapid Resolution Therapy (RRT) which is a much faster, more effective,
          and painless way of working through challenges.
        </li>
        <li class="text mb-4">
          I have traveled nationally to teach Resolving Sexual Trauma, a 5 hour
          course that teaches gentle strategies for the rapid recovery of
          survivors of sexual violence and childhood abuse.
