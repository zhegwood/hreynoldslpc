      If you are bothered by thoughts or feelings that you cannot get rid of,
      then Rapid Resolution Therapy is for you!
    </h2>
    <p class="text mb-4">
      Traditional therapy works with the prefrontal cortex, the conscious part
      of your mind, to help you change your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
      If the conscious part of your mind were causing these problems, then that
      would be a great solution. But the part of your mind that is setting off
      your nervous system is the more primitive subconscious part.
    </p>
    <p class="text mb-4">
      - That's why your thoughts or feelings don't make sense. We make sense of
      things with the conscious part, that's not where the problematic thoughts
      and feelings come from.
    </p>
    <p class="text mb-4">
      - The primitive subconscious part is there to help you survive, keep you
      safe, and to make bad things stop happening. When you think of something
      bad that happened in the past, the primitive mind doesn't understand that
      what you are thinking about isn't actually happening, and sets your
      nervous system in motion to make it stop happening now.
    </p>
    <p class="text mb-4">
      <span class="underline">Rapid Resolution Therapy</span> updates the
      primitive part of the mind so that it stops trying to fix problems that
      aren't happening, leaving you feeling happier, calmer, and more in control
      of your self.
