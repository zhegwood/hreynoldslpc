    <div class="mb-6">
      <p class="small-text mb-4">by Jordan Boehler</p>
      <p class="small-text mb-4">
        Everything began falling apart when Elaine's mother informed her of the
        family trip home to Sri Lanka next year. Elaine was both excited and
        terrified. She hadn't been back to Sri Lanka- and, in fact, she cringed
        when she heard the name- since she was a teenager. She hadn't been back
        since she was sexually assaulted by her father's friend. She didn't have
        much of a relationship with her father anymore. He was a constant
        reminder of Sri Lanka, of his now ex-friend. Any time she was around
        him, Elaine was angry and hostile. She couldn't be happy around him and
        she wasn't certain why. â€œLooking back, I blamed my father for letting it
        happen to me, but I never told him that."
