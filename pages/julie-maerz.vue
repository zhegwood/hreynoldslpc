          I have a Master's Degree in Counseling Psychology and Counselor
          Education from the University of Colorado at Denver and I am a
          Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC). I have a post graduate
          certificate in Trauma Stress Studies through the Trauma Research
          Foundation.

        <li class="text mb-4">
          I work with adolescents and adults. I have over 9 years of experience
          working in an Animal Assisted Therapy non-profit agency.
        </li>
        <li class="text mb-4">
          I have experience working with complex trauma, PTSD, sexual assault,
          abuse, depression, grief and loss, anxiety, and panic attacks.
        </li>
        <li class="text mb-4">
          I started training with Rapid Resolution Therapy in 2016. Since then,
          I have utilized the lens of Rapid Resolution Therapy while working in
          the Animal Assisted Therapy setting. Now I am excited to work in an
          environment that will allow me to focus more fully on Rapid Resolution
          Therapy.
        </li>
        <li class="text mb-4">
          I also believe that nature, exercise, mindfulness and interacting with
          animals can help facilitate healing. I have a Golden Retriever, Rosey,
          who is a certified professional therapy dog who may join sessions as
          appropriate.
