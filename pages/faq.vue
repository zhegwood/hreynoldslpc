      <h2 class="h2 mb-1">RRT Pricing</h2>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        Effective 5/1/23, a first session of RRT (1.5-2.5 hours) is $400.
        Follow-up sessions (45 minutes to 90 minutes) are $250. For those
        traveling a significant distance to meet with me or for those looking to
        get as much as possible done in a single day, I offer full day sessions
        (6-8 hours) for $1150.
      </p>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        25% off all sessions for therapists, veterans, and first responders.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h2 mb-1">What can I expect?</h2>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        In a first session of Rapid Resolution Therapy, I spend as much time as
        we need making sure that I have understood how things have been for you.
        Once you are satisfied that I understand things, I explain RRT's view of
        how our minds work. If that makes sense to you, we proceed. If it does
        not, we take the time we need to get on the same page.
      </p>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        Then, I will tell you where I think we are headed, and we take as much
        time as we need to make sure we are in agreement about how things will
        look when we are done with our session.
      </p>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        Once you are interested and excited about where we are going, and you
        are certain that I get it, I will take you through some relaxation and
        some visualization exercises to get primitive mind responding, since
        that is the part that needs to be updated. You will be conscious the
        whole time and responding to what I am saying. You will remember
        everything that I say to you. You will never feel out of control or "out
        of it".
      </p>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        I will clear up any impressions left by anything in your past that was
        "traumatic." By that, I mean anything that still causes negative
        feelings or thoughts when you think of it today. If you don't know what
        past events are "stuck", that's okay because your mind knows what they
        are and they will come to you. People are often surprised, as what comes
        up may not seem to have relevance or be particularly "traumatic."
      </p>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        For the last part of the session, we check in to make sure you are
        feeling better. People usually feel even better in the days following
        the session.
      </p>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        Follow up sessions can address other issues or can be useful if an issue
        has a long and complicated history.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h2 mb-1">One session?</h2>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        Sometimes one session is all it takes, but in my experience, that is
        about 20% of the time. Most people benefit from 2-5 sessions. Because of
        how RRT is sometimes marketed, I have had clients feel like they failed
        if they were not feeling all better in one session. Sometimes the
        problem is multifaceted, so it feels better after the first session, but
        not completely resolved. Other times, the mind has attached so much
        meaning to the problem (especially weight and prolonged sexual abuse)
        that we need several sessions to get it all cleared up.
      </p>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        Occasionally your inner mind is hesitant to bring up memories or to
        believe that getting better is actually better -- I know that sounds
        confusing, but it happens. I do know how to get your mind to cooperate
        with what you want, it can just sometimes take a little longer.
      </p>
      <p class="text mb-4">
        Panic attack and single traumatic events are most conducive to single
        sessions. Those events would include: car accidents, birth/medical
        trauma, rape, death of a loved one, phobias.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h2 mb-1">
        NeurOptimal<sup>&reg;</sup> Neurofeedback Pricing is based on the
        frequency of the sessions:

        Twice a week $75 per session ($150/week)<br />
        Three times a week is $65 per session ($195/week).
